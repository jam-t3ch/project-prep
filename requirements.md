## Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app

1. Security will be used through OAuth.

2. Simplicity for user.

3. Componentize the application so we can add later functionality with ease.

For the second we want the user to have a default enjoyable view. We'd like the app to be very intuitive based on what they see on their phones OS home screen, this way using the app will be simple.

For the third, we will have everything existing in React-Bootstrap Card components on homepage as buttons and displaying modals. For this reason adding a functional button into card grid and having it's functionality be nested within will make adding to app very simple.
