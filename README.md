# project-prep JaM TeCh

## What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

* Christopher: Google Fu and writing content
* James: Extremely strong technical skills, great at javascript and html structure, can execute problems with guidance and minimal help needed, strong ability to adapt and be flexible with the project's code.
* Michael: Adaptable, good with communication, good at front-end JS
* Tai: Debugging Logic and CSS Styling

## How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

* Christopher: I could take lead on researching/googling concepts we are lost on or new to, and I could be assigned tasks that will involve lots of content writing.
* James: Adaptable with a Growth Mindset and capability of articulating the concepts and language of the code.
* Michael: Aid in problem solving and work
* Tai: I can assist in debugging the application and finding where things are breaking.

## In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

* Christopher: I want to improve my technical competency when it comes to varying JS methods we’ve covered (and getting some familiarity with useful ones we haven’t yet). I also want to learn more versatility of Bootstrap components, how to style and adjust them for ideal aesthetic and functional performance.
James: Wants to improve communication within a team environment
* Michael: Want to improve at back-end understanding, but primarily to hone in on front end building as well!
* Tai: Would really like to get a handle on Auth0 and see what it’s really capable of. As well as improve competency in the JS language as a whole. I want to really componentize and make a clean application,

## Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

* Round table briefing every morning for group affirmations but to also get input from the other group members on direction and how to address problems. At those morning meetings we will discuss when we want to have debriefing and progress report for the day. Every day we will be sure to have an end-of-day round table where we discuss problem areas that we are finding or unsure of how to resolve and let everyone know the current status of their project portion. Then, we’ll thank everyone for their work before signing off.
* NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here.

# Conflict Plan

## What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

* Plain english communication without the need for the other person to be intuitive to what you are saying. “Say exactly what you mean.”
* Be kind in criticism specific to people.
* Commit to using I statements where possible.
* Commit to bringing forth a problem when it arises so that problems do not stew.
* Always have a third party present when the conflict is between two members.
* If things do get heated, take a 10, find some time to breathe and come back to it.
* If a problem can not be resolved within one hour, bring in an outside party to help mediate.

## What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

* Approach that person and with plain english communication, inform them that you feel like they are starting to take over the project and that you are feeling left out of the process.

## How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

* Rely on each other to help cover each other's weaknesses and bolster each other's strengths.
15 minute rule for asking for help. (If another member can’t help, find a TA)
* Be courteous and understanding of each other
* Be understanding that not everyone has the same skill level.

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

* check in with the person and see if there is anything the group can do to help.
* Can assign them to help pair program with another member
* Discuss the issue they are facing and help them resolve it (see conflict resolution plan)
* Pep talk!

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

* If problems can’t be resolved internally within one hour of being brought to the table, then external mediation will be sought.
